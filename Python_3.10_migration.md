Most of the projects that are blocking the Python 3.10 migration are not Python projects.  This makes it difficult for Python developers to contribute "fixes" to upstream.

Python projects:
1. https://github.com/aws/aws-cli -- Python 3.10 compatible last month
2. https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry -- Python 3.10 compatible
3. https://github.com/hylang/hy -- Python 3.10 compatible in 1.0 alpha pre-release
4. https://github.com/Diaoul/subliminal - No git mods since May 2020
